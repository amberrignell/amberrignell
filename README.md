### Hi, I'm Amber - a 22 year-old who has recently taken the leap :horse_racing: into tech and programming 

#### You may be wondering ... HOW ?? 

Programming is hard, but I've been given the great opportunity of completing  a free, four-month long bootcamp called Founders and Coders which is slowly but steadily setting me onto the path of full stack web development. 
You can track my progress through the weekly projects we have to complete, all linked to my github account. 

#### but ... WHY ???

Short answer ... why not ? 

Long answer ... 

- I got to do a fascinating internship at a [brazilian think tank](https://itsrio.org/) which focusses on tech and society
- One of the projects they were working on used blockchain technology to promote democracy by allowing people to sign petitions online (read about it [here](https://itsrio.org/en/projetos/mudamos/)) 
- I was surprisingly interested in the technical side of the project, and spent many hours delving into the knitty gritty theory of blockchain technology 
- When I got to university (UCL) , I took a range of modules from the Science and Technology Studies department such as 'Governance of Emerging Technologies' and 'Tech Journalism' as well as joining the blockchain society
- [London Blockchain Labs](https://londonblockchainlabs.com/) was set up and I became a member of the executive team, engaging the wider community by inviting speakers and organising workshops 
- I became increasingly frustrated by my own technical limitations and inability to be involved with the LABS team and their projects 
- I decided to do something about it and completed two [CodeFirst: Girls](https://codefirstgirls.org.uk/) courses before applying to [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/)

#### What am I passionate about ? 


#### What I'm looking for :eyes:

I'm looking for the opportunity to work as a full stack developer 
- in a team of interesting individuals who will help me increase my technical knowledge
- at a medium-sized company which is focussed on solving either a social problem or taking on a technical challenge 

so that in the future I can be in product management or CTO role, or set up my own scalable NGO or social enterprise
